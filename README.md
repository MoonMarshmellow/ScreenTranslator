**SCREENTRANSLATOR**

A simple script that captures a part of the screen and translates it to the preferred language by printing it to the console. The translation updates everytime the text on the screen changes. Uses the tesseract OCR library and the translate python package.

**Installation**

Clone the code and run main.py. Make sure you have python3 installed. 

**Use**

Inside the transtode() function change the language you are translating from and the language you are translating to. After running the code you have 2 seconds to place your mouse at the top left corner of the area you are capturing. After the position is registered you have 3 seconds to place your mouse to the opposite corner. After that the translation begins.
